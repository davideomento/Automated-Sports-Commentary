# LLMs for Automated Sports Commentary

This project provides an interface to generate **live football match commentaries** from minimal input descriptions. It can be particularly useful for:

- Apps that provide live commentary.
- Small football clubs that want to offer a live commentary service for their fanbase.

The project integrates **data and statistics from Transfermarkt** to guide the language model in generating coherent and context-aware commentary. It uses the [Transfermarkt API repository](https://github.com/felipeall/transfermarkt-api) for web scraping to extract player information.

## Features

- Select home and away teams.
- Start a match clock.
- Insert events with minimal descriptions.
- Generate live-style commentary enhanced with team and player stats.

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment** with Python >= 3.14.  
   ⚠️ Note: The Transfermarkt API repo requires Python 3.11, so make sure to specify that when installing the environment.

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. **Activate the Transfermarkt web scraping**:
   Follow the instructions in the transfermarkt-api repository. Some commands may have changed, so check for updated usage.

4. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   
A web page will open where you can interact with the interface.

**Usage**
